# Class-Prioritization-for-Hyper-parameter-Tuning
This is a replication package provided as an online appendix for the paper submitted in SBST 2020.

# How to reproduce the experiments?
In short, in order to reproduce the results, one can run EvoSuite on the classes that we experimented configuring the hyperparameters. The way the hyperparameters are configured are discribed in the EvoSuite Documentation available here.

 Although a replication package is available, I was not able to reproduce any
of the experiments described in the paper, neither any of the statistical
analysis presented in the paper. For instance, the `projects` directory only
includes the binary of 6 (the projects under study in the 6th edition of the
Java Unit Testing Tool Competition at SBST) out of the 19 projects; and there
is no script or instructions on how to reproduce the experiments.
